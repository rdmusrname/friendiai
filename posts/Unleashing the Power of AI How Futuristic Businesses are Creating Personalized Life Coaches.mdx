##  The  Rise of AI in  Coaching Businesses

Coaching has long been a popular approach for personal growth and development.

Whether it's through chatbots, virtual assistants,  or AI-powered platforms,  individuals can access coaching support whenever they need it, without the limitations of time and availability.
